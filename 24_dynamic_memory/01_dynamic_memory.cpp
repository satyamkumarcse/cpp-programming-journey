//                        { dynamic memory }

// dynamic memory is the memory that is allocated after the program is already compiled or running.

// for allocating dynamic memory, we use "new" keyword. its an operator
// its allows us to allocate memory in the heap rather than the stack

// its useful when we dont know how much memory we need.
// it makes the programs more flexible, especilly when accepting user input. 
//cause generally we dont have any idea what the user will type & how much emory it will occupy.
