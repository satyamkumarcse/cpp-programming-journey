// for loop is a loop that will execute a block of code a speified amount of times.

for(){

cpp program code


}

() ---> inside the curly brackets, we can write 3 statements at max, that will define how will the loop work. (initialization ; stopping_condition ; increment_or_decrement;)

//for loop is better in situations where you need to repeat code for a certain amount of times. otherwise while loop is also good.
