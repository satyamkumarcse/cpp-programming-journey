// why to use cpp? 

// cpp is very fast language 
//  used for advanced graphics apps (video games)
// middle level language, thus used for embedded systems.
// python,java,c# are high level language - resembles human language to an extent 
// cpp language takes efforts to write, but is very fast.


// we need text editor (vs code etc..) & compiler to create programs in cpp

// compiler converts source code (cpp file) ( the code written by us) to machine instructions (binary) (exe file)
